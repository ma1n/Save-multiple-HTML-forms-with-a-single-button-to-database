# Save-multiple-HTML-forms-with-a-single-button-to-database
Small PHP / HTML Script to get the data of a HTML form with multiple text fields and save it to a database.

Be sure to edit USERNAME, PASSOWRD, DATABASE, TABLENAME and COLUMNNAME1, COLUMNNAME2 and COLUMNNAME3 in the files. I might add a config file later on to make things easier.
